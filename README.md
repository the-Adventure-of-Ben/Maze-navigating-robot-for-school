# Maze-navigating-robot-for-school
This is the start of a project that requirse me to disign build and program a robot that is able to navigate a maze.
This is my VCE unit 2 assignment, this is an australian schooling system. it means that this is my project for unit 2 out of 4 units
we do 2 units a year so I am in my second last year of schooling before university.

I hope that explain why some off my coding (all of my coding) is not optimized and most likely doesn't work.

I will be adding my Design and building folio to here when it is compeleted (if it ever is).

_**RULES (Wishes) FOR USING MY CODE:**_

* If your are able to improve it or you are able to help in any way to the production and writing of code (especially the code) 
please reach out to me.
